2. There are some vidoes using voiceover. Please install [Manim voiceover](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/add_voiceovers.html).

3. Since I use Azure voiceover API, you need to fill in the .env with your keys. You can refer to [AzureService](https://voiceover.manim.community/en/latest/services.html).

4. run `manim -pql [filename]` to generate videos. You can also choose other options to run manim acoording to your need.

# Introduction
This is my manim code for YouTube channel [mastermathematics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ0KfcrJnTDGwFDXcPe6MZQ).
In this channel, I use the famous [Manim CE 0.17 Version](https://www.manim.community/) to generate math vidoes.

The following table lists all the python code and the corresponding vidoes generated in my channel. Please enjoy the code and welcome to watch and subscribe.
